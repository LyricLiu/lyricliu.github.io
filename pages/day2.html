                <p>Live video as a new media has become one of the most effective ways to connect with audiences. Instead of being silent viewers, audiences are more willing to regard the broadcast as a face to face conversation and express their feelings in real time. Youtube Gaming live is growing, but the interaction between YouTubers and audiences is limited. Here I present a design of youtube gaming interface to introduce my idea upon possible interactions during a live broadcast.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="para">
                <h2>Observation</h2>
                <div class="line1"></div>
                <p>I begin by directly involving in several live broadcasts on Youtube Gaming and observing how audiences interact with their You Tubers.</p>
                <p>I took the following notes:</p>
                <span>01. The needs of Audiences </span>
                <p> Self-expression (especially emotional expression) |  Communicate with the YouTuber | Arouse attention from other audiences</p>
                <span>02. The needs of YouTubers</span>
                <p>Gain more subscription | Get feedback | Earn some money</p>
                <span>03. Existing media conventions</span>
                <p>Comment (text and emoji) | Sponsor and Donation (money) | “Shout out” (voice)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="para">
                <p>Based on my note, I mapped the relationship between those targeted users within possible media conventions and try to envision new methods of interaction.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="para">
                <h2>Insight One</h2>
                <div class="line1"></div>
                <p>As the relationship between audiences and YouTuber are mostly N:1, the basic approach to facilitate better conversation is to come up with a filter mechanism to turn the conversation during a live broadcast into 1:1.</p>
                <p>There are two possible ways to achieve this:</p>
                <p>01. Find out communal interest</p>
                <p>02. Assign privilege to sponsor and donator</p>
                <p>For now, YouTube only adopts the second approach. Other SNS like “Twitter” has some relevant mechanism in the first approach.</p>
                <p>But, how about we combine these two approached together?</p>
                <p>Imagine this: You are a crazy fun watching a live broadcast right now. You really want to discuss with your favorite YouTuber about her new haircut and you believe a lot of people may want to discuss this as well. But you don’t want to spend a lot of money as a donator to arouse the attention of the YouTuber. You might hope to find a way to let your idea to be supported and then you will have more chance to be noticed. </p>
                <p>So, how about we adopt:  <span>Donation + Votes</span></p>
                <p>f you donate $2, you will need 300 other audiences to vote for you, before your topic pops up in the video for YouTuber to answer. If you donate $10, you will need 50 votes. If you donate $500, You don’t need any vote at all.</p>
                <p>Then, if you are an audience, you can choose between a <span>GOOD TOPIC</span> and <span>MONEY</span>!</p>
                <p>If you are a YouTuber, your can get both a <span>GOOD FEEDBACK</span> and <span>DONATION</span>.</p>

                <p>“I don’t really want to say something, I just want to express my emotion.”</p>
                <p>Let us try an easy but interesting way of expressing emotion:</p>
                <p>Just click the emoji that represents your feelings in real time. What you choose will sneak into a huge communal emoji hovered on top of the screen. You see other audiences' emojis moving towards the communal emoji as well. The system will calculate the widely selected emoji in a short time period and reveal it as a communal emoji.</p>
                <p>Of course, you can send a super emoji that allow your choice to last long.</p>
