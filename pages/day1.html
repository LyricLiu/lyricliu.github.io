                <p>There´s no better way to end the year 2016 than working for my website <span>lyricliu.com</span>!</p>
                <p>I spent the whole Christmas holiday to built this website. From VI/UI design to web development, I don't remember how many hours I have spent on it, but I still remember every moment my little idea has come true on the screen.</p>
                <p>I am very happy to present you, here -- how I design this website.</p>

                <h2>Identity design</h2>
                <div class="line1"></div>
                <p>I started up by designing my logo. Initially, I tried to find some pattern to represent myself. But I failed to satisfy myself with the patterns I illustrated. Then, I asked myself, why not just use my name! I spent the whole day scribbling my name on scratch paper. At the end of the day, I surprised to find the two “L” in my name could form a rectangle neatly! Yep, that is what you can see here. I pretty love it and even made several different color versions.</p>

                <p>I love pink, as always. Even though I tried to persuade myself to build a “professional” and “minimalist” website, I ended up following my heart. Below is my color palette.</p>

                <p>For the decorative patterns. I broke up my logo into 4 pieces. How can Lyric's work has no illustration! Then, I illustrated some cute patterns.</p>

                <h2>Development</h2>
                <div class="line1"></div>
                <p>Actually, this was the first time for me to develop such a complex static website. There were a great deal of animations and special effects which tortured me a lot.</p>
                <p>The hardest part was to make my website responsible to different kinds of screens.</p>
                <p>At least, for now, I guess my website could survive the mobile devices and the computers.</p>
                <p>Here is how it looks like in mobile phones: </p>
